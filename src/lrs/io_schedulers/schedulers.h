 * This algorithm will look at the load of the system (currently the proportion
 * of read, write and format requests) and allocate devices to I/O schedulers
 * based on the relative proportion of requests (i.e. if we have 40% of reads,
 * the read scheduler will use 40% of the available devices).
 *
 * This repartition is bounded by a min/max per tape technology. As long as an
 * I/O scheduler has at least one request to handle, it will get the minimum
 * number of devices.
 *
 * If an I/O scheduler has reached the maximum number of devices it can get and
 * its share of the devices is less than the share of its requests, the
 * remaining devices will be allocated to other schedulers.
