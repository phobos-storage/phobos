# CHANGELOG UPDATES

## Next
 * WARNING: change the `phobos ping [phobosd|tlc]` command to
   `phobos phobosd ping` and `phobos tlc ping`
## 3.1.0
 * limited number of write per grouping: the new "fifo_max_write_per_grouping"
   configuration parameter allows to limit the number of concurrent writes per
   grouping on one phobosd instance. The default 0 value reproduces the
   previous unlimited behaviour.
 * fix large sends (e.g. during a 'lib scan" with over 1500 slots)
 * handle external command errors better by using the glib2
   spawn_check_wait_status function
 * use the io_block_size parameter to set the write size of new objects on media

## 3.0.0
 * WARNING: the db schema moves from 2.2 to 3.0 and a migration is needed
 * WARNING: TLC section names in the configuration file are changed from
   [tlc_libname] to [tlc "libname"]
 * WARNING: phobos_locate has a new argument: the copy_name. The API
   compatibility is broken. (The lhsm_phobos copytool must be also updated.)
 * object copy create/list/delete is available, with "--copy-name" at locate,
   put and get, "get_preferred_order" configuration option taken into account at
   get
 * config man page is now available
 * autocompletion is added to CLI (check the README.md for more information on
   how to activate it)
 * the CLI arguments are homogenized between commands operating on the same
   target
 * fix client crash on "del --hard"
 * cli,api: default library for lib scan/refresh and ldm open is available
 * lrs: fix fifo find_write_device for unloaded tape without grouping
 * raid: check the real size of an extent against the expected size
 * locate: avoid locking media not compatible
 * fix miscellaneous memory leaks fix
 * bugfix: incomplete set of orphan extents when deleting with several replicas
 * lrs: bugfix when requeuing a format request
 * lrs: do not decrement the health counter without TLC
 * doc: add tutorial on automatic failover setup
 * autotools: add `cli` files when doing `make install`
 * add get to DSS schema migration continuous integration test
 * cli: internal code reorganization
 * podman: add a containerfile and postgres script
 * add repack and copy test to acceptance test

## 2.2.0
 * WARNING: the db schema moves from 2.1 to 2.2 and a migration is needed
 * WARNING: XFER structure is modified to old N objects and the API
   compatibility is broken. (For example, the lhsm_phobos copytool must be
   also updated to version 1.3 or greater.)
 * WARNING: the `alias` feature is renamed `profile`. In that extent, all
   `-a`/`--alias` options are renamed `-p`/`--profile`.
 * WARNING: the `-p` option, standing for `--lyt-params`, is uppercased, thus
   changed to `-P`.
 * WARNING: the mput is replaced by `put --file`
 * WARNING: tlc daemon is renamed phobos_tlc
 * grouping: this new feature is available to group objects on similar media.
 * no-split: we add a new `no-split` mode to put a list of object on the same
   medium.
 * `--new-library`: this new admin option is available to change the library of
   a drive, a dir, a tape or a rados pool.
 * `library` parameter is added to alias.
 * `distutils` dependency is changed to `setuptools`.
 * `io_block_size` parameter is extended by family.
 * `dir_full_threshold` and `rados_pool_full_threshold` options complete the
   `tape_full_threshold` option.
 * `listen_interface` setting is added for tlc.
 * `--library` option is added to phobos extent list.
 * `--errors` option is added to clear logs.
 * `--status` option is added to `phobos media list` and `phobos drive list`.
 * m4 scripts are updated.
 * build output are added to .gitignore.
 * refactoring of the CLI code has begun.
 * object copy feature developpement has begun.

## 2.1.0
 * WARNING: the db schema moves from 2.0 to 2.1 and a migration is needed
 * DSS code was rewritten to merge common code and create a specific file per
   resource type.
 * Multilibrary: Resource (tape or drive for example) can now belong to
   different libraries. Default libraries per family must be set in phobos.conf.
 * Rename: we can change the object id of an existing object.
 * Repack: we can copy non deprecated object of one tape
   to a new one and format the old tape to remove deprecated objects.
 * RAID4: a new 2+1 layout is available. Object is split on two media and a
   third one contains XOR.
 * --sort/--rsort: phobos extent/media/drive/object lists can be sorted.
 * Empty dir/tape/rados_pool deletion: medium without any extent can be deleted.
 * LTFS release: a phobos cli command is available to release the ltfs lock
   of one drive.
 * Hard deletion: --hard option is added to the delete command.
 * Object creation and access times are managed by phobos.
 * path normalization: dir path normalization (trailing "/" or relative path
   for example) are managed by phobos CLI and API.

## 2.0.0
* WARNING: the db schema moves from 1.95 to 2.0 and a migration is needed
* Device, medium: errors are now logged into the DSS and managed through a
  health counter
* TLC: Library is now accessed through the Tape Library Controler
* Extent migration between tapes is now ready and paves the road for the future
  tape repack feature.
* Tape import: we can now import into a Phobos system a tape from an other
  Phobos system (recovery or transfer).
* Phobosd media cache: to improve concurrency management, all components of the
  phobosd daemon (scheduler or device threads) share media info through a media
  cache.

## 1.95.1
* common: add xmalloc, xstrdup, xcalloc...
* ltfs: improve ltfs log with serial number
* ltfs: return an error if labels are different at mount operation
* pho_srl_lrs : fixed typedef name that was already used
* store, admin, cli: fix store and admin global context share
* LRS : fix unloading a tape from a source which is not a slot
* compilation : fix gcc compilation warning on RHEL 9 based system
* doc : add documentation for the currently_dedicated_to option
* tests: fix acceptance invalid bash syntax
* tests: fix an issue between test_store and test-driver
* tests: verify database after migration is as expected
* TLC (Tape Library Controler): introduce first features of this component even
  if the daemon is still unused (library open/close, drive_lookup, load)

## 1.95
* WARNING: the db schema moves from 1.93 to 1.95 and a migration is needed.
* Unused 'disk' value is removed from media and device family.
* compute XXH128 extent checksum in raid1 layout during put
* compute MD5 extent checksum in raid1 layout during put
* Retrieve MD5 and XXH128 checksums at extent listing
* Phobos API has been changed. Any call to a Phobos function must be done after
  initializing its context using `phobos_init()`. To release the context, use
  `phobos_fini()`.
* Add scripts and a binary to test tape library
* The "phobos_admin_format" API function has been modified to be able to format
media whose status is not blank. A "force" parameter is added to manage this.
* Locate update for pre-locking
    - We add two new parameters to the "phobos_locate" API call: 'focus_host'
      and 'nb_new_lock'.
    - We add the '--focus-host' option to the "phobos locate obj" command.
* Phobos CLI is updated. The options '--layout' and '--lyt-params' can also
  be respectively spelled '--lyt' and '--layout-params' for consistency.
* Creation of I/O schedulers for efficient request handling by the LRS:
    - FIFO and Group Read
    - Fair Share
* Added tape library certification tests to verify Phobos is usable with the
  targeted library
* Added designs for the media statistics, SCSI error management, Tape Library
  Controler.
* Add SCSI logs.
* Add TLC daemon unused and incomplete draft version.

## 1.94.1

* Added RADOS as data storage backend (no package available yet)
* Added module-loader to manage io, fs, dev, lib and layout adapters dynamically
* Added drive migrate command
* Improved command documentation
* Internal LRS parallelization (read, write and format managed by device
  threads)
* Added locate modification design
* Modified drive lock API and command:
    - The "phobos xxx lock" API has changed: '--force' option is removed. The
option was only considered with devices, so removing it for media will not alter
its behavior.
    - The "phobos drive lock" API has changed: '--wait' option is added. Its
behavior is the same as the previous '--force' option.

## 1.94

* The "phobos_admin_format" API function has been modified to be able to send
multiple format requests in a single call. The medium id provided thus becomes
an array of medium ids, and the length of that array is added as a parameter.

* The "phobos_admin_format" API function has been modified to be able to limit
the number of concurrent format sent to the phobosd. A "nb_streams" parameter
is added to the parameters of the function, with 0 signifying "send all requests
at once".

## 1.93

* The "simple" layout is no longer available. It cannot be used through the CLI
and will not be recognized in the API anymore. Instead, an alias has been
provided in the default template.conf, emulating the "simple" layout behaviour.
The layout used is "raid1", with a replica count set to 1.
